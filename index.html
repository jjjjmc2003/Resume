        <!About>
        <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
<p>
    I’m a senior at New College of Florida majoring in Computer Science, with an Associate of Arts in Accounting. My academic background merges technology, problem-solving, and business thinking — giving me the versatility to tackle challenges from both a logical and practical lens. Whether I’m writing code, analyzing data, or managing projects, I enjoy finding creative solutions that are both functional and user-centered.
</p>

<p>
    I’ve developed hands-on experience in Python, Java, and C++, building everything from a casino simulation to a 2D game engine using SFML. My senior thesis focuses on applying machine learning and interactive visualization to historical Major League Baseball data — combining my love for sports and data science into a meaningful project that tracks the evolution of hitting strategies over decades. I’ve deployed full applications using Streamlit and hosted them on GitHub, focusing on clean design and accessible storytelling through data.
</p>

<p>
    My experiences as a multi-year college baseball player have shaped me beyond the classroom. Playing at a high level across multiple schools taught me how to adapt quickly, lead by example, and stay disciplined even when the stakes are high. I know how to manage my time, balance priorities, and show up for a team — whether it’s on the field or in the workplace.
</p>

<p>
    At my core, I’m driven by curiosity, creativity, and a desire to grow. I love working on projects that involve building systems from the ground up, improving user experience, or uncovering insights through data. My long-term goal is to blend my technical skills with entrepreneurial thinking to build tools or products that help people solve real problems. I’m excited to continue learning, creating, and contributing wherever I go.
