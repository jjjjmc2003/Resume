        <!About>
      <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
<p>
    I'm a senior at New College of Florida graduating in May 2025 with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. I also hold an Associate of Arts in Accounting from Palm Beach State College. With this academic foundation, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and business insight, supported by hands-on experience in software development, embedded systems, game development, and machine learning/data science.
</p>

<p>
    My software development portfolio includes a C# Unity web app game deployed on Azure, an animal shelter management platform built with JavaScript, Node.js, and Vite, and a “Stress-Free Calendar” web app created using Python and Streamlit. In the embedded systems space, I developed a red-light traffic control system in C++ using an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which introduced me to low-level hardware integration and real-time logic. My game development experience includes the Unity game mentioned above, a casino simulation written in Java using object-oriented design principles, and a C++ arcade-style game developed with SFML.
</p>

<p>
    My senior thesis focused on machine learning and baseball analytics, applying PCA, t-SNE, and K-means clustering to explore how Major League Baseball hitters have evolved from 1950 to 2010. In addition to publishing the paper and successfully defending it in a BACC exam, I deployed a Streamlit-based web application to present the findings. I also integrated a GPT-3.5-powered chatbot trained on my dataset to answer baseball-related questions and provide insights from the analysis.
</p>

<p>
    Outside the classroom, I’ve played college baseball since 2021, balancing academic rigor with athletic commitment. This experience has shaped my leadership, time management, and ability to perform under pressure. I’m passionate about solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and building tools that are both functional and user-centered. Whether writing code, analyzing data, or leading a team, I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to make a meaningful impact in everything I do.
